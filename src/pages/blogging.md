I've never had a blog before, I've decided to create this blog as a project for #100DaysOfGatsby. Creating a Gatsby blog from scratch was the week 1 challenge. 

Blogging is not something that comes easy to me, but I do see the potential of it. It is another avenue in which to get your name out into the world. If enough people see it, well, then maybe the right people will see it and say “aha! I must ask this person to come into my office for a job interview!” I mean, that probably won’t really happen, but a programmer can dream. 
I’m unsure of what to talk about in a blog, I will say that right now I’m listening to “Funkytown” by Lipps Inc., while I type this blog post out. It's poppy and I feel like Monica from FRIENDS bopping along to this song.
