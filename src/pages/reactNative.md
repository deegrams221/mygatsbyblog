## React Native

#### Getting Started

I've decided to expand my knowledge, and I thought React Native would be something fun to learn. So far I love getting to use the Android Studio Virtual Device. I think it is so cute! I remember working with a few iOS developers at Lambda School, they always had the cute little iphone simulator running. Getting that Android Virtual Device running on my computer was so exciting and it felt like a big win. I know that sounds silly to some people, but that's okay.

Below are some images from one of my very first React Native projects. This is a basic "Scratch and Win Game":
