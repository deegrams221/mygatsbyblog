I was trying to think of what I should write about for my second blog post and I decided to write on something that I have been spending the majority of my time on, Lambda School.

Lambda School is a (remote) Computer Science & Software Engineering Academy that provides an immersive hands-on curriculum with a focus on computer science, web and mobile development, UX design, data science, and computer science.

I started Lambda's Full Stack Web Development program in July 2019. I've met a lot of people and I've made some friends while attending Lambda. Lambda has given me the opportunity to work with people from all over the US and EU.

Last month I started working for Lambda as a student Team Lead part time (yes I get paid), while I continue to attend as a full time student. It has been a lot of work and long hours. My school day (Monday through Friday) begins at 9 am and ends at 6 pm, I have an hour for lunch around noon and effectively an hour for dinner, and then I start work at 7 pm and end my day between 10 and 11 pm. These long days while draining are also very rewarding, I'm getting a lot done and learning so much!

Currently in my student curriculum, I'm in my third week of learning Python. And the group I'm the Team Lead for is in it's third week of Labs. In Labs, the team has been assigned a project to work on, it will be a living project that future teams will work on too. Labs is meant to simulate a real world work enviroment, we have a project manager (me), engineering manager, product manager, and a stakeholder. The team is comprised of 2 UX designers, 2 IOS developers and 4 Web developers. I'm also working through a few Udemy courses on project management so I can be an effective team lead.
