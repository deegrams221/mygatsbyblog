#### My Background

I graduated from the Full Stack Web Development program at Lambda School in May 2020. Before I decided to become a web developer I worked in special education, and behavioral therapy working with children with special needs for almost 4 years. It was working with these amazing children and the various technologies they needed to work with that made it clear how important accessibility in technology is.

#### Why should the web be accessible?

The internet is for everyone.

From a company's viewpoint, wouldn’t you want as many people as possible to be able to use your site and access everything you are trying to share online? The world is made up of potential customers, these potential customers are all different people with different levels of abilities.
Being accessible will provide you the capability to reach more potential customers throughout the world. Why not do everything you can to make it easier for people to view your website or app?

#### What is web accessibility?

Web accessibility is sometimes referred to as **a11y**, this is the abbreviated version of the word ‘accessibility’: "**a**" followed by **11** letters, ending with "**y**".

According to the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html "React documentation"), “web accessibility is the design and creation of websites that can be used by everyone. Accessibility support is necessary to allow assistive technology to interpret web pages.”

#### Areas to Consider for A11y

No site can ever be 100% accessible but you can do your best to make it as accessible as possible. Any website or app can be improved through accessibility, there are multiple small things you can implement and changes that can be made to improve the accessibility of a website. The following is a list of the areas to consider for A11y when you are building a new site or app:

The A11y Project also has a useful checklist to help you improve the accessibility in any app you are building: [A11Y Project Checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/ "A11Y Project Checklist")

#### Common Challenges with A11y in React

- Infinite wrapper div tags
- Lack of focus management when navigating between routes
- Understanding what accessibility means within a project

#### Ways to Overcome Common A11y Challenges in React

- Sometimes you can use [React Fragments](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html "React Fragments") to group together multiple elements instead of using infinite wrapper div tags.
- To manage the issue of a lack of focus management when navigating between routes try using a router that has accessibility built in, like [Reach Router](https://reach.tech/router/accessibility "Reach Router").
- Take advantage of dev tools or browser extensions to scan the DOM for an acceptable outline for your JSX, and help with understanding how to structure your project to make it accessible for everyone.
- In general, reading React’s [accessibility documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html "accessibility documentation") will get you started on the right path towards A11y!
