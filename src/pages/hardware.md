## Learning About Hardware

I'm currently taking a course through <img src='https://people.withyouwithme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/70c8d9af-wide-blackgreen-01-5.png' alt='WithYouWithMe Logo' width='65'>, it's an IT Fundamentals course. This cousre is the first step on the path to becoming a Cybersecurity Analyst.

#### Some of the first terms I learned are:

<ul>
    <li><b>IoT (Internet of Things)</b> - the network of physical objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet</li>
    <li><b>Turing Complete</b> - fully programmable, virtually all programming languages today are Turing complete</li>
    <li><b>Microprocessor</b> - performs calculations, an integrated circuit that contains all the functions of a central processing unit of a computer</li>
    <li><b>SoC (System on a Chip)</b> - complete computers on a single chip, containing a microprocessor and memory</li>
    <li><b>RAM (Random Access Memory)</b> - temporary memory</li>
    <li><b>Client Machine</b> - personal computers</li>
    <li><b>Server Machine</b> - computers that share/serve their resources to authorized client machines</li>
    <li><b>Mainframe</b> - enterprise server, high-performance computers with large amounts of memory and processors that process billions of simple calculations and transactions in real time,a mainframe is critical to commercial databases, transaction servers, and applications that require high resiliency, security, and agility</li>
    <li><b>Super Computer</b> - mostly used for research, a computer with a high level of performance as compared to a general-purpose computer</li>
    <li><b>Quantum Computer</b> - smaller than super computer but more powerful</li>
</ul>
